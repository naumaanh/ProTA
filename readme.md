## Directory Structure
In our main directory there are two loose files: readme.me & group-info.md. Our readme is what you are currently reading from and contains general information about our project. We then have two folders: documents & source. Documents will house all of our deliverables as well as meeting minutes.along with any other extra files we may have.
